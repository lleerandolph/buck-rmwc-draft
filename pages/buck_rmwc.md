## Coming to Randolph-Macon Woman's College

Pearl Sydenstricker Buck was born in Hillsboro, West Virginia, on June 26, 1892, to Presbyterian missionary parents. Her family returned to China when she was an infant, and she spent her early years in the city of Zhenjiang. Buck received her early education from her mother and a Chinese Confucian scholar, later attending missionary schools and a high school in Shanghai. She entered Randolph-Macon Woman's College in 1910. A philosophy major, she was active in student government and the YWCA and wrote for the college's literary magazine, *The Tattler* and yearbook, *The Helianthus*.
