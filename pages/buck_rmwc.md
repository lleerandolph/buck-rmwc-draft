## Coming to Randolph-Macon Woman's College

Pearl Sydenstricker Buck was born in Hillsboro, West Virginia, on June 26, 1892, to Presbyterian missionary parents. Her family returned to China when she was an infant, and she spent her early years in the city of Zhenjiang. Buck received her early education from her mother and a Chinese Confucian scholar, later attending missionary schools and a high school in Shanghai.

Pearl enrolled at Randolph-Macon Woman's College in 1910, and felt like she entered a different world.  Pearl's lack of understanding of American culture made adapting to her new life very difficult.  Similarly, the college's other students did not understand her differences or show interest in Chinese culture, outside of the classroom.  Rather than succumb to her loneliness, Pearl realized she would need to learn more about the new culture she lived in and become involved with campus life.

Fortunately, she soon met Emma Edmunds who would become a lifelong friend.  Emma recalled their initial meeting at R-MWC:

*"I remember my first day at college...the girls all seemed at home and so sophisticated, and I felt so countrified. Then I saw this one girl and she looked even more countrified than me. Her dress was made of Chinese grass linen and nobody else had anything like that...Pearl looked terribly different. I felt sorry for her, somehow, I knew how she felt, and so I dared speak to her. That's how we met."*

While Emma entered a sorority, Pearl joined the Franklin Literary Society, a society which conducted dramatic readings and encouraged writing competitions.  Thus began Pearl's writing career.  During her freshman year, she published her first story titled "The Real Santa Claus" in the college's literary magazine, *The Tattler*.

A philosophy major, Pearl continued writing poetry, short stories, and essays for *The Tattler* and the R-MWC yearbook, *The Helianthus*.
