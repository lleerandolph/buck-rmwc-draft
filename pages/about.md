## About the Items in this Collection

This site features images and documents from the Randolph-Macon Woman's College & Randolph College [Archives](https://library.randolphcollege.edu/archives), and is built using [CollectionBuilder-CSV](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-csv).

The Randolph-Macon Woman's College & Randolph College Archives exist as a special collection through the efforts of Roberta Douglas Cornelius, Class of 1909, author of The History of Randolph-Macon Womanâ€™s College, Professor of English, and the sole person to hold the title of College Archivist. Her papers comprise the only subject index to the history of the college.

Many college publications are preserved in the Archives such as the College Catalog, *The Sundial*, *The Helianthus*, the Student Handbook, and student literary magazines. In addition, with the remodeling of the Smith Memorial Building in 1985, the Alumnae Association contributed student scrapbooks and memorabilia. At the same time, the Office of College Relations augmented the photograph file and newspaper clippings file with many items from the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s; and has continued providing the library with photos dating to the early 2000s. The Archives also include published material by college faculty and alumni.

## About the Narriative

The narriative of this site was adapted from the paper, *Years Around the Even Post: Pearl S. Buck and her Alma Mater* by Joy Elizabeth Abbot, class of 1992.  Ms. Abbot's paper was presented at the Pearl S. Buck Centennial Symposium held at Randolph-Macon 
Woman's College on March 26-28, 1992. It was prepared by Ms. Abbot as an 
independent study under the supervision of Frances E. Webb, Reference Librarian.
